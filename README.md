## Features üöÄ  

1. **GPS-Based Gate Control**  
   - Utilizes GPS data to automatically open gates when an authorized vehicle approaches within a defined radius.
   - High-accuracy positioning ensures timely and precise gate operation.  

2. **License Plate Recognition**  
   - Employs computer vision and machine learning to identify and authorize vehicle license plates.  
   - Supports both whitelist (authorized users) and guest vehicle management.

3. **Time-Based Guest Access**  
   - Allows scheduling of guest visits with precise start and end times.  
   - Automates gate access for guests within their allowed time window.

4. **Smart Lighting Control**  
   - Activates outdoor lighting automatically during nighttime for safety and visibility.  
   - Provides manual override via the web interface for user convenience.

5. **Web Interface for Guest Management**  
   - User-friendly interface to manage guest schedules, view logs, and monitor system activity.  
   - Allows adding, editing, and removing guest schedules in real time.

## How It Works üåü  

1. **Vehicle Detection**:  
   A camera detects an approaching vehicle and captures its license plate.  

2. **License Plate Verification**:  
   The system matches the license plate against a database of authorized users and scheduled guests.  

3. **GPS Validation**:  
   The vehicle's location is validated using GPS data to ensure proximity to the gate.  

4. **Gate Operation**:  
   If all conditions are met, the gate opens automatically and optionally turns on outdoor lights at night.  

5. **Guest Scheduling**:  
   Guests can be granted temporary access by specifying their visiting times via the web interface.  

6. **Smart Lighting**:  
   Outdoor lights activate automatically during nighttime or can be manually controlled.
